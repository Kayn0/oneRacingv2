				<p>As the manager of your own Formula One race team, with a starting budget you need to purchase a driver, chassis and power unit for both of your cars. After each F1 race weekend your drivers, chassis and power units will recieve points based on the race results. In addition the value of each part will rise or fall depending on its performance in the race.</p>
				<p>Just before the start of each Formula One race weekend a lockout will be established, no longer allowing trades or upgrades.</p>
				<p>
					<span>Please note:</span><br />
				 	If either of your cars are missing a part (driver, chassis, power unit), then no points are scored for that car.

				<p>You start the season with twenty trades. Each time you swap a part, it will cost you one trade.</p>
				<p>During your first round all trades are free, so experiment with different combinations of drivers, chassis and power units until you are happy with your team.</p> 
				<p>If you're running low on trades you can purchase additional trades, look for the + icon on the team page.</p>
				
				<p><span>Don't forget</span><br />
					When you make a trade you recieve the value of the traded item.
